          Childhood
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a young boy, my family started to call me &ldquo;Atom Smasher&rdquo; a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Rothstein" target="_blank">comic book character</a> from the 80's.
          Ever since then it's been a nickname, although Adam is my real name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creativity in my life started with my father, who would often show me how to draw cartoon faces.        </p>

        <h3 class="text-center">
          Middle School
        </h3>
        <p>
          In middle school I attended standard art classes as well wood shop. I made a pretty sweet cutting board that
          my mother still has on her counter!
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-center">
          High School
        </h3>

        <p>
          I elected to take several art-focused classes including painting, sculpture, and drawing.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my last two years of high school I was introduced to Photoshop and Quark by a few friends working
          on the school newspaper.  I was hooked from that point on!

          College
        </h3>
        <p>
          I attended college at The <a href="http://www.iadt.edu/" target="_blank">International Academy of Design and Technology</a> in Chicago, Illinois.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2001 I received my Associate of Applied Science in Computer Graphics / Graphic Design. I immediately
          returned to pursue a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Multimedia Production and Design, received at the end of 2002.

        <span class="icon-brain scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">How I do it.</h3>
        <p>
          Some prefer to call it process or approach, I say call it whatever you like, really.

        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-research scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">Research</h3>
        <p>
          I start every project with research. I believe it is the most important part of understanding what we're building,
          who we're building for, our competitors, and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research is both internal: to understand the goals and milestones, and external: to understand similar products,
          tools, etc.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-interview scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          Interviews are the next important piece to a project.  A user interview allows our team a unique, outsider's perspective.
          By conducting the proper research, we can now target the correct users to interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          User interviews are typically conducted with internal team members, stakeholders, existing users, future users, customer service
          employees and more.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-personas scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">User Personas</h3>
        <p>
          Developing, documenting and maintaining user personas for your products is a key ingredient to ensure we
          are meeting the needs of our users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to handle user personas like a style guide - a living document that should always be up-to-date.
          That also provides huge value to the entire organization.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-strategy scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          Defining a strategy for your product can be the secret sauce that so many organizations scratch their heads over.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can help define an interface, interaction, gamification, and experience strategy alongside the team.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-architect scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding and documenting the architecture of the product is another valuable artifact within
          an organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          The architecture documentation serves to help every department understand interconnected
          views and functionality they may not be aware of.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-sketch scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">Sketches</h3>
        <p>
          One of my favorite parts of the design process is sketching.  Sketching comes in the form of a pencil
          and paper or a marker and a whiteboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the discovery, collaboration, and deep thinking that I love
          about this part of the creative process.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-wireframe scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          Creating wireframes is the point in a project where things start to have a heart beat.  It is where
          stakeholders and the team begin to see things come to life.  Where smiles get bigger.
        </p>
        <p>
          I prefer to start wireframes as simple, static, grayscale line art. As progress and approval funnels in,
          I begin to add simple interactions that eventually turn into complex interactions.  I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.axure.com/">Axure</a>.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-prototype scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">Prototypes</h3>
        <p>
          I love interaction design. I enjoy prototyping with tools such as Axure, my personal favorite.
          I also enjoy designing directly in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prototypes bring life to a wireframe.  They show developers the guts of what they are building and make designers
          push themselves to think about complex micro interactions.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-visual scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">Visual Design</h3>
        <p>
          Visual / User Interface Design is another passion for me, it's how I got started in this industry.
          I find a lot of pleasure in applying the branding, typography, and styles to new product or feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy this phase of a project because it really brings out the excitement of the stakeholders and team.
          It also starts to blend the major components of the user experience together.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-document scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">Documentation</h3>
        <p>
          Documentation is a crucial piece of communication that bridges the gap of a wireframe, visual design, or prototype, and the implementation.
          It allows the designer to communicate to the engineering team the tiny bits of vision that all of our combined tools today cannot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a neat <a href="http://blog.bitovi.com/combining-documentation-with-prototypes-6/">article I wrote</a> on combining prototypes with a specification.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <span class="icon-code scroll-icon zoomInDown" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="0s"></span>
        <h3 class="text-center">Code</h3>
        <p>
          One of the characteristics that make me unique is my deep knowledge of the front-end. I have a very
          strong understanding of HTML and CSS.  I have worked in just about every language and stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy engineering HTML and CSS architecture, style guides, interface components and responsive implementations of the product.
          There's something special about building your design directly alongside the engineering team.
          The collaboration and velocity gained in this phase is very valuable.
        </p>
        <hr class="story-separator" />
        <p>
          Working within each of these areas, or "in the trenches" as I call it, is what I love to do!  My brain is
          wired to think this way and I am lucky to have found this gift intersecting with my career.

        <p>
          I grew up camping with my mother and father as a young boy and later my father and I camped a lot too.
          Today, wy wife and I <a href="https://instagram.com/p/3wi2pNr6As/">enjoy camping</a> a lot. Our <a href="https://instagram.com/p/3wjD_KL6BF/">latest trip</a> was the entire Northwest sector of the States.
