# Atom Groom - Available for hire.

Hello, my name is Atom Groom.

I am available for hire full-time.

Resumes are kinda lame, I think you'll like this little site better. Scroll on down the page to understand how I can serve you, and see if we're a great fit!

## My Work on this site
* I wrote all the content based from my experiences. My wife helped edit it since I am not a great writer.
* I designed and created all the icons in Illustrator
* I hand-coded 90% of the CSS with some help from Stack and a few other sites / libraries.
* I hand-coded all of the HTML

## How the site was built
* Build, Live Reload, LESS compile, CSS/JS Minify are all using Grunt
* Enquire.js - for firing off Wow.js media queries off in certain viewport sizes
* Wow.js - triggers css animations
* Animate.css - for Wow.js animations (all other animations are my own).
* Google Fonts: Raleway and Roboto
* Icomoon: used to base64 encode my custom icon library

## Run it locally.
* I can't imagine you would want to run this site locally, but if you do...
* clone the repo
* make sure you have node and grunt installed
* run npm install
* run grunt serve and naivgate to localhost:8080
* run grunt build to compile to dist/
